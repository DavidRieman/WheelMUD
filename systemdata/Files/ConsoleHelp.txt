Welcome to the $MudAttributes.Version release of $MudAttributes.MudName

$MudAttributes.MudName is a framework to help you build
your own (Multi User Dungeon) MUD games.

This application acts as the game server, and
so is not very interactive. To do anything
useful you need to connect to the game using
a telnet client. From this machine you can
connect to ip address 127.0.0.1 and port $MudAttributes.TelnetPort

Extra help is available on our website at
$MudAttributes.Website or http://wheelmud.codeplex.com

Commands Available:
    SHUTDOWN - Closes the server
    HELP - Displays this text
