WheelMUD
========
C# MUD framework.

## Overview
WheelMUD is a framework for creating Multiple-User Dimensions (MUDs) using the .NET platform and the C# language. Being built on modern tools and techniques, WheelMUD will allow MUD administrators to build their world and customize the code far easier than the MUDs of yesteryear.

## Project Information
There is lots of information about WheelMUD, and [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) for WheelMUD, available right here in the source tree.
Get started at the [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) root, where you will find things ranging from the [Project Goals](Documentation/ProjectGoals.md) to [Development](Documentation/Development/README.md)-oriented information.

There are a lot more information in old discussions and design documents buried in [muds.gamedev.com](http://muds.gamedev.com). We are in the process of rebuilding GitHub-friendly documentation and design documents from the gems hidden within. Please bear with us on that front.

## Super Quick Start
For those who know git, code, and telnet already and want to jump right in.
* Fork the repository.
* Download the code (IE https://github.com/WheelMud/WheelMUD.git).
* Open the solution, preferably in Visual Studio 2013.
* Build and Launch.
* Once the server is ready, telnet localhost 4000.
The [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) also includes a far more detailed [Getting Started](Documentation/GettingStarted.md) section.

## GitHub Processes
* Feel free to introduce yourself and ask questions and such in the Issues section. General banter will likely eventually be closed, after any issues/bugs/tasks have been diligently extracted to separate, tracked issues.
* Please comment on an issue if you plan to take it on, so we do not accidentally duplicate efforts.
* Pull requests should generally target WheelMud/WheelMUD.
