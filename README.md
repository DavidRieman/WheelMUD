WheelMUD
========
C# MUD framework.

## Overview
WheelMUD is a framework for creating Multiple-User Dimensions (MUDs) using the .NET platform and the C# language. Being built on modern tools and techniques, WheelMUD will allow MUD administrators to build their world and customize the code far easier than the MUDs of yesteryear.

## Project Information
We have lots of information and documentation for WheelMUD.
Get started at the [Documentation](docs/README.md) root, where you will find things ranging from the [Project Goals](docs/ProjectGoals.md) to [Development](docs/Development/README.md)-oriented information.

WheelMUD has had a [long history](docs/ProjectHistory.md), having migrated hosting sites/strategies multiple times and continues to evolve.
There is a lot more information in old discussions and design documents that have been preserved in captures from forums of old; We are in the process of rebuilding GitHub-friendly documentation and design documents from the gems hidden within those archives. Please bear with us on that front, and ask if you would like information or guidance on a particular feature or area of interest you'd like to get involved in, so we can prioritize accordingly.

## Quick Setup
Here's the short version of the setup instructions, mainly for seasoned developers:
* Meet the framework runtime requirements [listed in Basic Prerequisites](docs/BasicPrerequisites.md).
* Get the code and build the entire solution (not just the ServerHarness dependencies).
* Launch ServerHarness.
* Once the server is ready: telnet localhost 4000.

## Thorough Setup
See [Getting Started](docs/GettingStarted.md) from the [Documentation](docs/README.md) pages for a more thorough walk-through to get up and running.

## GitHub Processes
* Feel free to introduce yourself and ask questions and such in at the [Welcome Thread](https://github.com/DavidRieman/WheelMUD/discussions/20) in Discussions.
* Please comment on an issue if you plan to take it on, so we do not accidentally duplicate efforts. We are also starting to experiment with the GitHub Projects tab, so feel free to check that out.
* Pull requests should generally target DavidRieman/WheelMUD.
