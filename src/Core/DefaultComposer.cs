    /// <summary>A class for simplifying common composition tasks.</summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// TODO: Migrate this documentation to .md and reference that instead from Priority members? (And link it from other docs.)
    /// 
    /// WheelMUD uses an extensive composition system to bring together various parts and systems dynamically.
    /// 
    /// The main goals of this system are to:
    /// * Allow game customizations to occur independently from "core" code.
    /// * Allow easy "plugging in" of external parts and systems.
    /// * Allow for "recomposition" scenarios.
    /// These goals help support additional benefits:
    /// * Keeping "core" modifications to what are true improvements of core code rather than customizations will
    ///   improve the ability for a derived game to continue taking merges from the main WheelMUD repositories,
    ///   and improves the ability for the community to contribute back to everyone else through pull requests,
    ///   since developers generally won't have to "sanitize" a bunch of game-specific changes to do so.
    /// * Developers should have an easier time sharing individual parts and systems in interesting ways, such as
    ///   publishing NuGet packages with specific extension functionality.
    /// * Ability to "recompose" on the fly mainly supports non-reboot code updates, meaning less down time and
    ///   interruptions of your gamers for code upgrades. For example, if you've fixed a bug in a GameAction and
    ///   locally tested it, you could drop the tested DLL into your running MUD folder, and run "update-actions"
    ///   in the ServerHarness command prompt. (Eventually we may implement file watchers and automatic updates.)
    /// 
    /// To best support these goals, export attributes can implement IExportWithPriority and use DefaultComposer
    /// functions to compose those parts and systems. DefaultComposer will select one instance from each class
    /// name with the highest, non-zero "Priority" value. Core parts tend to export with priority 0, while any
    /// sample game system parts (such as the default WarriorRogueMage sample implementation) use priority 100.
    /// You should pick a value like 200 for any parts you want to replace. For example, if you decided to fully
    /// replace how the "tell" action worked in your specific game, you could create a new class in your own
    /// game's library called "Tell" that inherits from GameAction with [CoreExports.GameAction(200)]. Your version
    /// would always get loaded instead of the core version.
    /// 
    /// In case of ties to "Priority", DefaultComposer will inspect the FileInfo where the classes came from, to
    /// pick the version that was latest modified. This tie-breaker is mainly to support the non-reboot-update
    /// recomposition path: If you keep making code modifications, testing them, and deploying them to your live
    /// server as additional temporary DLL files copied in, then DefaultComposer will keep selecting the one you
    /// newest ones. (You will likely still want a proper deployment process including reboots occasionally, but
    /// having the option to live-patch minor safe fixes can reduce many player inconveniences.)
    /// 
    /// If you want to disable a part or system, you can set a negative Priority to have it ignored. Note that
    /// you will not want to pair this with non-reboot updates as any existing DLL found with a higher Priority
    /// will win load preference and bring back that older version. Depending on the part/system, you may find
    /// it better to disable pre-existing versions by exporting your own gutted version with a higher Priority.
    /// For example, exporting a new "Tell" class with [CoreExports.GameAction(200)] but with no action aliases would
    /// make it so nobody in the game could use the "tell" command any more. These may be useful strategies for
    /// emergency disabling of problematic parts, until the problem can be properly solved and reintroduced.
