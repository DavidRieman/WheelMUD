        <p>Some key things you probably noticed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unique colors are used to identify different <i>types</i> of Things that the player can interact with, making it visually easy to identify just what you're looking for (such as exits, if you are in a hurry).</li>
            <li>Only the usable keywords of the Thing were highlighted with color, making it easier to identify what to type to target it. On-line creator tools could be used to enforce short and long descriptions include at least one usable keyword.</li>
            <li>These colors need not be final, but for example purposes, we used distinctive colors for: Spell names, Spoken text, Room name, Exits, Furnishings (room sub-details), Mobiles, and Other Things (often Items that can or cannot be picked up).</li>
            <li>There should be reusable targeting system code which helps look in many places for your interaction target by some selected priority order. E.G. in your inventory, in the room with you, as a room furnishing, etc.</li>
            <li>There should be a targeting disambiguation system which makes it really easy to identify and "fix" name collisions, solving one of the more frustrating usability aspects of typical MUDs.
            <li>This disambiguation system should retain the "context" of the previous command, so that if the user enters just "2" then it'll try to repeat the command with the second target.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During disambiguation, context may change the validity of the command. E.G. a target may move, or the player may be following a group that has left, and so on. So one way disambiguation could be done is by remembering the last command, and substituting any targeting argument words with the full unique instance ID of the target. E.G. under the hood, perhaps the player entering "2" after "wield swo" would translate into "wield thing/id123456" under the hood. (The player should not actually be shown the ID though.)</li>
            <li>The player can ignore the disambiguation prompt and just type some other command like "east". They don't have to explicitly cancel the prompt; As soon as the prompt was not used in a command, it can "expire".</li>
            <li>The player can use the disambiguation prompt to change their mind about what to do. For example, the player might "exa gob" to issue a "safe" command, which tells them there is "1) goblet" and "2) goblin" and then "punch 2" as a successful command targeting the goblin's unique ID.</li>
            <li>It may be best to have On-Line Creator (OLC) tools dissuade or block the creators from using numbers as keywords, to avoid complications. E.G. "two-handed" would be allowed but "2-handed" would not.</li>
            <li>If there are a lot of targeting results, perhaps instead of trying to build a long list from "exa b" we could print something like "A lot of things nearby match `b`. Can you be more specific?"</li>
        </ul>
