WheelMUD Design
===============

## User Stories
User Stories are design documents which convey the general utility or feel of a feature or feature set, by walking us through an envisioned scenario from the user's perspective.
These documents will use a black background to represent the more commonly used color schemes of light-on-dark, as used by the default settings of most popular Telnet clients.
The ">" will generally be used to represent the player's prompt, and text that follows such a prompt demonstrates the text commands the user has sent to the server.
The following user stories are available:
* [World Interaction](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DavidRieman/WheelMUD/blob/master/Documentation/Design/UserStory_WorldInteraction.htm)
