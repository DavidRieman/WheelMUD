# WheelMUD Project History

## Origin
The WheelMUD initiative originated in 1998. Over the years, the code-base has changed wildly.
A couple of times, the project code has been largely or entirely scrapped and rebuilt.
The earliest attempts were actually Visual Basic initiatives (starting at VB4).

We're finally at a point where it really feels like our direction is solid and the technology is capable of meeting our goals.

## Leadership
The leadership team here has also, slowly, changed over the years.
In February 2015, Fastalanasa has decided to transfer the Champion role over to David Rieman.

So, a little about me:
I've been officially part of the WheelMUD initiative since, if I had to guess, some time in 2009.
Most of my professional career has been programming in various capacities in the video games sector.
I grew up on MUDs (among other games) and of course have many fond memories of them.
I never adopted a "favorite" flavor, instead admiring games who implemented stunningly customized features or large social populations.
I hope that some day WheelMUD will inspire a rebirth of unique MUD games, with depths far greater than the multi-player graphical games of today.

As with previous Champions, I am happy to take on various onerous administration tasks, so that other contributors can focus more on the aspects of contributing that are the most fun or fulfilling for them.
