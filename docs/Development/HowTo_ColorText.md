# How To: Color Text in WheelMUD

## Tagging
We are using a very similar tagging scheme as MudOS.
ASP.NET programmers will feel right at home.
The ANSI codes are stored in the ANSI table in the WheelMUD.net.db SQLite database.
Here's what they look like:

Use the entries in the Tag column.
The tags come in pairs just like any tag based mark-up language like HTML, ASP, and XML. Make sure to reset the colors buy using the normal or reset tags.
