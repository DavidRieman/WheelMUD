# WheelMUD Project Goals

## Vision
WheelMUD is a modern Multiple User Domain (MUD) engine. WheelMUD provides a platform on which to build your own text-based MMO.

## High Level Goals
* Accessible to average hobbyist coders.
* Capitalize on an untapped market of MUD coders.
* Help coders develop job skills.
* Attractive, approachable code base.
* Stable.
* Performs well enough to be a viable platform for running even the most popular MUDs.
* Continuous improvement.
* Above all, Have Fun!

## Supporting Goals
* Runs on Windows (at minimum).
* Development will be confined to modern, accessible languages such as C#.
* Utilize modern development environments, and other common job tools and development practices.
* High encapsulation. Strong separation of concerns.
* Highly testable code.
* Accessible to common .NET performance tooling and stress testing techniques.
* Foster active, engaging community. Ease of integration (for entire code-bases, content, and/or specific features/components) between MUDs built on the platform. Ease of content creation.
* The players aren't the only ones having fun!
