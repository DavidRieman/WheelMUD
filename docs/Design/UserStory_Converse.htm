    <p>Additional notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basically a special command processor mode which "falls back" to the regular command processor with input that started with "." (after stripping the "." for the fallback attempt).</li>
        <li>Some edge cases to consider deeper might be that other special modes could potentially kick in, like after issuing a "dot command" which resulted in Paging mode or Y/N confirmations, etc. Perhaps the user just has to keep "dotting" those interactions like ".Y" to confirm, or ".end" to ineract and then go back to conversation mode.</li>
