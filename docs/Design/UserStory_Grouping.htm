    <p>Additional notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For grouploot, we could have robust grouploot options as inspired by modern graphical MMO games, out of the box.</li>
        <li>In this example, we see grouploot settings that are heavily tied to a game system or setting (e.g. magic item teirs and auto-identify settings would be a weird way to organize looting for a space combat setting).  It will take some thinking to organize what aspects can be Core and which will be Reference Implementations.  Perhaps Core can have very basic random loot distribution tactics, and reference implementations could expand with additional options.</li>
        <li>While many aspects of "grouping" may be game-specific, we could strive to have reference implementations and Core code which help assist with such gameplay systems.</li>
        <li>A command form like `tell group hi` might be awkward if a player is also allowed to be named something like `group`. WheelMUD should offer a default deny-list of invalid character names, to block confusion with character names like `group`, and dynamically include all registered command keywords in that deny-list. (Also a partial deny-list to block profanity and slurs and the like would be helpful as well.)</li>
        <li>We could use the Renderers system to define the group status rendering, taking a list of Player Things to render information about. Thus this could be implemented in the game-system layer (showing game-system-specific stats for each character) and exported for pickup by the WheelMUD Core group commands without having to mess with the commands themselves.</li>
        <li>Help file for grouping could describe how to set some `auto-follow` setting (which could have its own help file too, or at least for a general `settigns` command) to control whether your character should automatically start following a group leader when joining a group, or only if they are a friend, or not at all.</li>
