# Contributing in WheelMUD

## Non-Coding Contributions
Even if you are not interested in coding (or are not very technical), there are a variety of other ways we can use your help. (While historically most of our contributors have been coders, we've had a few non-coders who have certainly added value to the project.)
For example:
* Testing and bug/issue management.
* Fostering community.
* Telling your friends about us / attracting coders.
* Documentation.
* Eventually, area/world building.
* Eventually, organizing UX (User eXperience testing) sessions.
* Design discussions.
Note that participating in design does not necessarily mean "we will build your ideal MUD for you"; Our goal here is to build a MUD framework with a variety of base features that we generally agree will be useful or in demand for most MUD implementations.
We are trying to start with those that are most necessary for a healthy, basic social MUD, and then moving on to augment that core with polish features and reference implementations of gameplay systems.

### Bugs
If you have a decent handle on a bug, feel free to see if it is tracked already in the [Issues](https://github.com/DavidRieman/WheelMUD/issues) tracker on the core WheelMUD branch, or you can add the issue if it isn't present.
Alternatively, you can open a new discussion thread. Please report bugs; I'd rather have unresearched bugs sloppily reported to the forums than no bug report at all!
Bug fixes make great candidates for a developer to get their feet wet and test out the pull request process.

### Ideas and Requests
Design suggestions and feature requests are best posted first to the [Discussions area](https://github.com/DavidRieman/WheelMUD/discussions) on GitHub.
We value fresh discussion and opinions even on old threads, so don't be afraid of searching for and posting feedback onto a "stale" thread.

## Development
If you are, or have the drive to become, a developer: Visit the [Development](Development/README.md) section.

## Conduct
We strive to build a fun and friendly community here. Please remain civil in all communications here.
