# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability that you feel should be handled privately:
Feel free to use the [Security](https://github.com/DavidRieman/WheelMUD/security) area to report the issue privately instead of using the Issues tab.

Although WheelMUD does not have notable user-facing servers at the time of writing, these issues will become much more sensitive and appropriate to handle privately and quickly when we do.

Thanks!
